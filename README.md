# Drone Detection Project
## Overview

This project aims to develop a drone detection software using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The software is designed to detect and classify drones in real-time using input from a camera, enabling users to identify and track drones in various environments.
Features
 - Real-time drone detection using Android phone camera or USB webcam
 - Machine learning model trained to recognize drones
 - Integration with Android app for easy deployment and usage
 - User-friendly interface with live camera feed and detection results

Technologies Used
 - Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Android (for mobile application)
- Machine Learning (CNN)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:
Clone the repository:
```git
git clone https://github.com/carlos-gmartin/drone-detection-project.git 
```

Install dependencies:
```git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Setup your phone to webcam mode:

Launch the application:
python main.py

Follow the instructions on the screen to start the drone detection process.

Usage
 - Launch the application on your PC or Android device.
 - Point the camera towards the area where drones are expected to be present.
 - The software will analyze the camera feed in real-time and display detected drones on the screen.
 - Users can track and monitor drone activity using the application interface.
